                    EGEM is the stable, pure, no pre-mine coin with applied technologies peernet and per block endowment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What does that really mean, though?
                </p>
                <p>
                    EtherGem, "EGEM," is first and foremost, a pure community coin with no pre-mine. True to its roots as a cryptocurrency, the Proof of Work mining
                    community will always be a part of EGEM's future and is the foundation of the EGEM launch. There is no ICO on EGEM and EGEM is its own primary
                    blockchain, not just a token or concept on another chain. The EtherGem blockchain is an Ethereum network, meaning it starts with the tested and proven
                    Ethereum (as in ETH) core technologies and builds from there. Technically, EGEM is an Ethereum chain as described in the yellow paper, with EIP150,
                    EIP155, EIP158 applied from block 0. Block Rewards have 7 eras of reduction, including a dev reward enabled after block 5000. Developers and Community
                    Managers are bound by a continuity agreement to maintain the network, community, and coin. There is no cap to EGEM at the moment. A monetary cap will be
                    put in place when the community determines that the logical progression would be to cap the coin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An "applied technologies peernet" is where the EtherGem blockchain grows on a mineable token sidechain. Dual mining ethergem and a token is something
                    new. The EGEM sidechain is designed to be very much an integral part of ongoing mainchain development, where peers can implement new technology
                    while continuing to rely on a solid foundation. The sidechain and token will be available shortly after the mainnet release.

                    Interested in earning a return on your EGEM holdings? EGEM quarry nodes allow node operators to receive EtherGem in exchange for running a node. There are
                    currently two tiers of nodes:
                    <ul>
                        <li />Tier 1 - 10000 EGEM Collateral
                        <li />Tier 2 - Tier 1 Node &amp; 30000 EGEM Collateral
                    </ul>
                    As the EtherGem network grows, there are plans to add additional node tiers with increasing returns. This gives node investors the ability to exponentially grow
                    their holdings as they acquire more EGEM. Click <a href="https://github.com/TeamEGEM/EGEM-node-install" alt="Node Setup Instructions">here</a> to access the
                    GitHub code for setting up a node.
